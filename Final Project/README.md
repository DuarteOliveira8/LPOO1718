## GUI
**Main Menu**
The Main Menu is the first thing to appear when the user opens the app. It has three options: level selector, play the game and settings.

**Game**
When the game starts, the block is fixed while the scene moves, and the user clicks on the screen to make the block jump and surpass from the obstacles. When the block jumps, it also rotates. The HUD is present throughout the whole game, and it shows two elements: the percentage of distance the player has achieved; and the pause button where the player can choose to resume or leave the level.

**Level Selector**
The user can choose which level to play on the level selector menu. In this menu, all the levels available to play are displayed and if the user has played the level previously, it shows the percentage of the best run and/or if the level was completed.

* Test if the game is lost when the block hits an obstacle while dropping from a jump
* Test if the game is lost when the block hits an obstacle on the top while jumping
